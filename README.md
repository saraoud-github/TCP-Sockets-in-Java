# TCP-Sockets-in-Java

Servers are supposed to run for a long time without stopping; therefore, they must be designed to provide good service no matter what their clients do. This project tackles two possible scenarios to disrupt a TCP server and the required solutions that can handle these disruptions. The attacks can be found inside [Attack 1]() and [Attack 2]().

## How to run each scenario

1. Run TCPServer.java
2. Run multiple instances of TCPClient.java
